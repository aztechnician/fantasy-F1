Fantasy F1 is a program designed to automate the scoring process for an original Formula 1 Racing Fantasy League that my friends and I developed.
At the moment, it requires a handmade .csv file (that I make) to function, which includes the results for every driver at every event for a given F1 Race Weekend.
This isn't an exorbidant amount of extra work for me, as I follow race weekends fairly closely, but in the future I would like to find a way to automate acquiring this information.

The example .csv file included for this project is the results for the 2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Weekend, which occured just a few weeks before I wrote this program and was the final race of the season.
When the program runs, the user will be prompted to input the three letter code that identifies the driver they would like a score for. 
These are typically based on the driver's last name; I would encourage you to start with HAM, which will provide the results for my favorite driver, Lewis Hamilton!
To see all features of the program, the you'll also want to try it with VER, as that driver achieved points for things others did not.
A full list of driver codes will be provided by the program if the user inputs anything not recognized as valid a driver code.
